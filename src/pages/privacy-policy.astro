          In-Between Labs builds small, offline-first creative tools. Your privacy matters. This policy explains what
          information is collected and how it is used in our applications.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white/90">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Our apps do not require user accounts and do not collect personally identifiable information such as your
          name, email address, or phone number.
        </p>

        <p>
          Images, audio, and other media you load into the app are processed locally on your device. We do not upload,
          store, or transmit this content to our servers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white/90">Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          Some apps may display ads provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect anonymous usage data or device
          identifiers in accordance with Google’s privacy policies in order to serve relevant ads.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may remove ads permanently via a one-time in-app purchase where offered.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white/90">Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We do not use custom analytics or tracking systems. Any limited diagnostic data collected is handled by the
          Android operating system or Google Play services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white/90">Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white/90">Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our apps are not directed toward children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
          children.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white/90">Changes to This Policy</h2>
